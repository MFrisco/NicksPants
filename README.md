# Nick's Pants
Developed by Meghan Frisco using Auto Hotkey.

This tool automatically keypresses based upon the following user-specified parameters:
1. Key
2. Time between presses
3. Length of time to run the script (in minutes, 0 = infinity)

Once the parameters are entered, press RUN. The application will begin executing in three seconds. The entered parameters may also be saved for future runs "File - Save as Default"
